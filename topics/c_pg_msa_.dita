 <title>MIPS SIMD Architecture (MSA)</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>MSA extensions can be enabled by providing the following command-line option to the C
   compiler:</p>
  <codeblock>&lt;prefix>-gcc -mmsa â€¦ </codeblock>
  <p>MSA instructions and vector registers are available directly for hand-written assembly. The
   compiler also provides C-style built-in functions for all MSA instructions in conjunction with
   vector-type data structures to target vector registers. The preferred coding style is to use
   regular C arithmetic operators on vector data types and fall back to built-ins for complicated
   MSA instructions which the compiler is unable to relate to vectorized C code.</p>
  <p>Examples are provided in <ph conkeyref="c_biblio/msa_pg"/> and also on the <ph
    keyref="var_cdsdk"/>.</p>
