 <title>Boot Code</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Two variations of MIPS Boot code are included; one is intended to work on all possible
   implementations and one is tuneable to reduce code size and increase performance when preparing
   production code. Some aspects of boot time initialisation canâ€™t be done without core specific
   information, where this can be detected then an error will be reported unless appropriate code
   has been provided. Boot code makes use of two special sections:</p>
  <dl>
   <dlentry>
    <dt>reset</dt>
    <dd>Only one object in the entire link should contain a .reset section and it must implement the
     reset vector. It is recommended to place a non-weak symbol called __reset_vector at the start
     of the module so that the linker will detect if multiple such modules are included.</dd>
   </dlentry>
   <dlentry>
    <dt>boot</dt>
    <dd>Used for any other boot-time code referenced from the reset vector. This code is placed
     immediately after the .reset section and this memory should be usable from cold boot.</dd>
   </dlentry>
  </dl>
