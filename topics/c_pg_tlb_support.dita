 <title>TLB Support</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The HAL provides support for the initialization and maintenance of the CPUâ€™s memory management
   Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). For 32-bit TLBs, the memory management functions are supplied
   by including <codeph>mips/m32tlb.h</codeph>. For 64-bit TLBs found on either MIPS64 or MIPS32
   with XPA support enabled, the functions are supplied by including
   <codeph>mips/m64tlb.h</codeph>.</p>
  <p>Users should consult relevant Privileged Resource Architecture document and the Programmer's
   Guide for their processor when using the TLB as some aspects of TLB operation are implementation
   specific.</p>
