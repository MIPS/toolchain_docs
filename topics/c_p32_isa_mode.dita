 <title>ISA mode</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The nanoMIPS architecture does not include the concept of an ISA mode. Unlike microMIPS and
   MIPS16 there is no meaning applied to the least significant bit of a code address and it is
   interpreted as part of the target address and will trigger an address exception if set.</p>
