# CPU Configuration Controls

These macros define CPU-specific configuration options. The various defaults
are listed and the rationale behind them is explained. The defaults are
deliberately conservative for functional correctness. Where the defaults do
not correspond to the processor being targeted, providing correct values for
that processor will yield better performance.
